<h2>Metamorphosis: The Nikouo Art</h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
    We are so thrilled to announce our new project: <b>metamorphosis</b>.
    <b>Metamorphosis</b> is spanning a universe at the crossroads of art, sciences and philosophy.
    The first stage of <b>metamorphosis</b> is a book titled: the Nikouo Art.
    We aim to turn the book into A bestseller of all time.
    Our lowest expectation is to sell a minimum of 200,000 copies a year
    and 5,000,000$ in gross revenues.
    The Nikouo Art is just an entrypoint to the universe.
    We expect to draw most of our revenues from goodies and advertisements,
    by merchandising the universe itself as a product.
    We aim for exponential revenues from this, a bare minimum is 100,000,000$.
</p>
<p>
    Nikouo universe is framed for an unbounded market.
    As the main plot spoke about sciences and God which are general existential concerns.
    But if there are to say target customers:
    Late teens and young adults are expected to relate to the universe, as the main plot is about a “metamorphosis” and they themselves are experiencing “metamorphosis” in their own body.
    African Americans are expected to relate to the narrator who is a failed black scientist struggling with degrading mental health.
    People of buddhist background, namely South and East Asians. They  are expected to relate to the deep philosophy.

    We NEED 200,000$ as a bare minimum to fire the Nikouo universe with the sufficient strength to light-up a global audience. The universe has been scripted to become an advertisement firestorm. And we plan to start the firestorm with necessary quality. Here is a draft of the front and back covers of “The Nikouo Art” >> click here.

The backstory of “metamorphosis”
“Metamorphosis” started as a scientific communication with Harvard University that never reached the general audience. The communication had a groundbreaking impact, so groundbreaking that the communication was hurted with unbearable obstacles. We decided to disrupt the normal flow of scientific communications riddled with policies and take the communication to the general audience. We reworked the communication into a style adapted to the general audience. That restyling ended-up in an artistic universe where deep science is versed into poetry and geometries. Don’t be misled, “The Nikouo Art” is profoundly a scientific communication. And the reader will have an emotional journey, drowned into the “Nikouo” universe. The reader will travel into disturbing places and in the end might realize the exact nature of the “Nikouo”.
The Nikouo art engineer.
